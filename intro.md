```{tab-item} Things I learned!
- About the versitility and utility of a Jupyter Book. I did not realize these exist. An employer would very much appreciate the time and effort these require when selecting a candidate.
- About the interesting capabilities of using tags to convey commands across multiple platforms.  
```

```{tab-item} Things I found Difficult!
- The names of some of these functions are very confusing. Particularily this phrase: 'Add a table of contents for the sub-sections of a page within the page content (in-line with the content on the page)'. With research and practice I understand what was said, but first glance was extremely difficult.
- Hiding cells feels like something that could be done without ever knowing what Metadata is. For some reason I could not find the Metadata Cell menu for a long time which was difficult. Even now, I'm not sure I understand what the purpose of Metadata is.
